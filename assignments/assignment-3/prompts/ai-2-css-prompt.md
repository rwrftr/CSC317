dear chatGPT PLEASE make me a css stylesheet for my website based on ancient egypt!!! Please make use of copious animations and the papyrus font, and don't be afraid to add tacky elements. The camp-ier the better lol. [image1](image.png) [image2](image-1.png)

If you want to use images (and you should) please please please make 100000% sure they actually exist.. If you want, I can give you some image links to get you started:
