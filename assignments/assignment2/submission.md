##  HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment

### Description:
Assignment 2 asks us to create a basic html website with info about ourselves, images, an iframe, a form, and other foundational html elements



## Approach / What I Did:
I followed a fairly linear approach, keeping sections and elements stacked on top of each other. In the first 2 sections I wanted text or an element to appear alongside the images I had added, and so I used the style attribute and specified to the image that it should float on the left side of the page, with a 20 px gap before the next element. 



## Code Explanation:
Highlight key parts of your HTML code and explain their purpose. Use code blocks for clarity.
