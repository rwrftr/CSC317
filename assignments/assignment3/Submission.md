## Analysis
This assignment was super challenging for me. Looking through my notes, the lecture files, and w3schools helped me make a long css file that styles every element of my website. By the end of creating it, I had a website where every element was placed nearly exactly how I wanted it, but reading the CSS code, I felt that it was disorganized. I had trouble getting the AI to create something expressive, it often would make similar stylesheets to the other responses, albeit with different colors. In the end, I feel that the most unique style it ended up giving me was in the animations and background images, so when it came time to redo my first one, that's what I included. The difficult parts, for me, was when i wanted t move specific elements in my webpage. For example, the linkedin and frog buttons at the bottom were, for some reason, giving me so much trouble when i tried to center them. I think CSS is an incredibly powerful styling tool, and I found creating and molding my own visual identity for the website to be a lot of fun. The hybrid one feels the most personal, as I grew up riding those 'old' muni buses with the brown and tan seats. I thought about including more pictures, but ultimately stuck to the background and color scheme. I also made the font for the headers look like those displays on the insides of the buses that tell you what the next stop is. I felt like the AI styles were 

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to apply stylesheets to an HTML page, I learned how to style different elements of an HTML page using classes and IDs and how to specify styling on some elements but not others. I learned some javascript which was surprisingly the most fun part of the whole assignment. I enjoyed theming things with colors, but got frustrated trying to move things around especially when elements were next to eachother in the same flex box but not vertically centered compared to eachother that always gave me such a headache. I learned how to use animations and I actually had a lot of fun making them. I think if I did this again I would be much more capable when it came to structuring my HTML doc so that it could be styled much easier. 

## Preferred Version
I prefer the second AI-generated solution, because I like the boxes around the entire sections, and also that the boxes are centered and have shadow. I just think this version looks the most polished, whereas the others definitely feel like theres at least one or two elements you can point at and say "this part looks sloppy". I also like the animations the most in this one, although I would have liked for some more things like images to be animated too.
